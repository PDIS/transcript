I’m the lead facilitator, Richard Haddock with the George Washington University.

Our partners at the Elliott School that helped make this podcast happen are the Sigur Center for Asian Studies and the GW Institute for Korean Studies.

The views and opinions expressed in these podcasts are those of the speakers alone and do not reflect the position of the NRC. Through these podcasts, we want to encourage dialogue about diverse perspectives in East Asian Studies. Check on our website @nrc.elliott.gwu.edu for all our podcast episodes and info about East Asian Studies at the George Washington University. Now let’s start the conversation.

### Richard Haddock:
Thank you everybody, thank you listeners for tuning in to our newest episode of the East Asia Hotspots podcast. And I have with me an incredibly special guest, Digital Minister of Taiwan, Audrey Tang. She’s the first openly transgender government minister in the world. Minister Tang is known for revitalizing the computer languages, Pearl and Haskell as well as building the online spreadsheet system EtherCalc in collaboration with Dan Bricklin. In the public sector minister Tang served on the Taiwan National Development Councils Open Data Committee and the K-12 Curriculum Committee and led Taiwan’s first e-Rulemaking project.

### Richard Haddock:
In the private sector minister Tang worked as a consultant with Apple on computational linguistics, with Oxford University Press on crowd lexicography and with Socialtext on social interaction design. Minister Tang actively contributes to Taiwan’s g0v, a vibrant community focusing on creating tools for the civil society with the call to “fork the government.” Minister Tang, thank you so much for joining us.

### Audrey Tang:
And hello world, I’m really happy to be on this podcast.

### Richard Haddock:
Great, thanks. So let’s dive into the questions here. So Minister Tang, you’ve been an important contributor to the incredible work on digital democracy and civic tech fronts in Taiwan from g0v to  
hosting hackathons to creating new and innovative platforms such as vTaiwan that allows citizens to be a part of the governmental decision making process. You have also been an advocate for implementing an open government model using these kinds of tools. What is open government and how is it part of Taiwan’s contemporary national narrative?
