# 2018-11-17 Interview with Jaromil

### Audrey Tang:
...let’s start again.

### Jaromil:
Hi, everyone! I am in Taipei with all the Dyne.org crew.

### Jaromil:
We are the lucky guests of the conference on the intelligent urban fabric.

### Jaromil:
I have the honor to be here with the Digital Minister of Taiwan: Audrey.

### Audrey Tang:
Yes! I’m Audrey Tang. I’m a poetician -- I write poems.

### Jaromil:
We are... \[laughs\] That’s very unpredictable and fantastic.

### Jaromil:
You remind me of our friend, Birgitta Jónsdóttir, that is also a great poet, and a great minister as well...

### Audrey Tang:
...and also anarchist.

### Jaromil:
...also anarchist, fantastic.

### Jaromil:
Basically, I am here to ask you about the platform that we run, Algorithmic Sovereignty Observatory in Europe.

### Jaromil:
What is the impact that you see in your work, and on the society of Taiwan, of algorithms?

### Jaromil:
The most powerful impact that they have, and what can be fixed? What can be improved?

### Audrey Tang:
For the sake of brevity, I’m just going say &quot;code&quot;, but when I say &quot;code&quot;, please think &quot;algorithm&quot;.

### Audrey Tang:
Code is having a large impact, of course, because code is like law, but it’s not a law of text. It is a law of physics.

### Audrey Tang:
In cyberspace, code determine what can happen, what cannot happen; what is transparent, what is opaque; and things like that.

### Audrey Tang:
It establish a normativity that is legal by design, just like physics. You cannot violate a physics law, because it’s just not possible, right?

### Audrey Tang:
This basically has a different position than a text-based normativity, where you can do something -- it may or may not be illegal -- depending on the interpretation.

### Audrey Tang:
The impact is having a pre-set boundary that is either agreed by the social norm, which is a positive impact; or it’s set by a few people, which is a negative social impact.

### Jaromil:
That’s a fantastic suggestion. Also, should we talk about code? What is the difference between code and algorithms?

### Jaromil:
Code sometimes is a little bit more boilerplate, no? Algorithm is at the core, like how does it function.

### Jaromil:
I’m curious, why do you shift it to code?

### Audrey Tang:
First, because &quot;code&quot; and &quot;text&quot; are both one syllable. In a poet’s words, they rhyme better.

### Audrey Tang:
As for algorithms, it’s very difficult to rhyme &quot;algorithm&quot; with any other word... &quot;Anarchism&quot;, I think, rhymes with &quot;algorithm&quot;.

### Audrey Tang:
In any case, yes, the algorithm, of course, is the spirit that imbues itself in the code.

### Audrey Tang:
So when I say &quot;code&quot;, think &quot;algorithm&quot;, but what affects people is a manifestation of the algorithm, which is the code.

### Audrey Tang:
They are two: In the spirit, it’s algorithm. In the flesh, it’s code.

### Jaromil:
So it’s very much like law?

### Audrey Tang:
Yes, and like other spiritual beings. \[laughs\]

### Jaromil:
Hopefully, law experts that are watching us understand the nuance and understand how valuable is this transfer...

### Audrey Tang:
...well, the legal hermeneutics evolved from the spiritual hermeneutics, so they totally understand.

### Jaromil:
Fantastic, and you totally understand how to speak to Europeans.

### Audrey Tang:
Yes. \[laughs\]

### Jaromil:
I think you are very lucky here in Taiwan to have the legacy that you are creating. There is a government that is very enlightened. You are very young in spirit, in mind, but also...

### Audrey Tang:
...totally non-partisan. Post-partisan.

### Jaromil:
....and very dynamic. I hope that in Europe, we see more and more hackers that can actually shape and relate to the new generations.

### Audrey Tang:
To fork the democracy.

### Jaromil:
Yes. \[laughs\] We are working on it.

### Jaromil:
Thank you very much, Audrey.

### Audrey Tang:
Thank you so much. Cheers.

### Cameraman:
That is the best definition of algorithmic platonism I’ve ever heard.
