# 2024-03-19 Conversation with OpenAI

### James Hairston:
Hello? Hi, how are you today?

### Audrey Tang:
Pretty good, long time no see.

### James Hairston:
I know, I know, really great to see you, and introducing my colleague, Sandy, who will be leading our work in Asia moving forward. She'll be based in Singapore, so just wanted to also introduce the two of you one-to-one on this call as well.

### Sandy Kunvatanagarn:
It's a pleasure to meet you.

### Audrey Tang:
We're in the same time zone then.

### Sandy Kunvatanagarn:
Yes.

### James Hairston:
[Redacted]

### Audrey Tang:
Of course.

### James Hairston:
So we wanted to reach out and follow up, you know, in our last conversations, promise to just sort of come to you and give you a preview of sort of major announcements and capabilities, and so we have a new feature and pilot sort of launching this week that we just wanted to talk you through here quickly today and get any feedback and just open up the lines of communication sort of going forward.

### Audrey Tang:
Great. So does this work in real time?

### James Hairston:
[Redacted]

### Audrey Tang:
Because the adversarial case is different. Will there be a sort of Content ID?

### James Hairston:
[Redacted] But again, we'll double-check on sort of all of the mitigations and come back to you there as well.

### Audrey Tang:
Does this policy not create a case where it advantages incumbents in an election?

### James Hairston:
[Redacted]

### Audrey Tang:
You already do that for DALL·E 3. The C2PA is also compatible, just to flag that.

### James Hairston:

### Audrey Tang:
Are there going to be a similar process around this, when you do a stepwise release of Sora?

### James Hairston:
[Redacted]

### Audrey Tang:
I mean, there's already, you know, Stable Video Diffusion. And so with that capability, and just as for your reference, tomorrow we're going to the parliament to discuss a new amendment for a digital signature act.

Coupled with the new anti-fraud act, the upshot is that for advertisement, which is about freedom of reach, not freedom of speech, we are going to require that any advertisement — not just [political ones](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/d909ff7a-en/1/3/2/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/d909ff7a-en&_csp_=037651e38039b75bbb486a006bf55a63&itemIGO=oecd&itemContentType=book#section-d1e2529-d3c95cbc71) — instead of relying on watermarking and/or detection, which is fragile, we're going to flip the default and say that they would require a valid digital signature to be posted.

Of course, we're going to work with interoperability with other countries. But the upshot is that if somebody impersonates 1,000 different public figures, we will have a way for the KYC process, for the advertiser, it could be YouTube or Meta, to know that it's actually pointing to the same natural person. Of course, we can enhance its privacy profile with zero-knowledge techniques.

And I think the sooner we flip to a digital signature required, everything else is assumed to be a robot, the better. Because otherwise, we're just playing whack-a-mole.

I mean, if watermark works perfectly, we don't need this. But in a world where watermarks are defeated by open weights models regularly, we need a second line of defense.

### James Hairston:

### Audrey Tang:
Great. And I believe we will meet with other OpenAI teams soon to get an update from other angles.

### James Hairston:
Really glad that your teams will be catching up with other OpenAI teams soon.

### Audrey Tang:
Great. Anything from Sandy? Sorry that we've been hogging all the conversation.

### Sandy Kunvatanagarn:
Okay. No, no. It's a pleasure to meet you. And I love working together as I'm getting up to speed on the role.

### Audrey Tang:
Excellent. I'm just always an email away. All right. Thank you.

### James Hairston:
Well, thank you. We'll be in touch soon. Yeah, we really appreciate your time and all of this great input. We're really grateful.

### Audrey Tang:
Okay. Awesome. Well, see you next time then. Live long and prosper.

### James Hairston:
You too. Bye bye.

### Sandy Kunvatanagarn:
Bye bye.
