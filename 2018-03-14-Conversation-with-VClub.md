# 2018-03-14 Conversation with VClub

### Hillary Liu:
2 Books we are in the process for.

### Hillary Liu:
AI Book for Traditional Chinese if we can work with the China Publish as they have Simplied Chinese now.

### Hillary Liu:
SE Dream Books from Chinese to English version.

### Hillary Liu:
That’s one of the things we are looking for. \[laughs\] That’s his saying. We want to seek for the collaboration. We think your team here, that we could maybe work with one of the great teams, that they could make this.

### Hillary Liu:
We were talking about you with two young artists, they probably should just join this base or do some reading campaign. We think it’s awesome, and they are so...

### Audrey Tang:
Wow, 林爽文... This is very local content.

### Hillary Liu:
Yes.

### Audrey Tang:
This is super local.

### Hillary Liu:
Yes, and then they have the compassion for Taiwan and for Formosa, for the local Thailand. Then we want to utilize our international network to help them to spread the good story. Now, they are talking about they will put this as the animation. Also, the 繪本 for the storybook...

### Audrey Tang:
Illustrations.

### Hillary Liu:
...for the kids. Then we think it’s a awesome thing, this is the young people that will learn. This is the thing. If we could help them with the base here, they say they want to come. I say, &quot;I will tell Audrey that you want to come.&quot;

### Audrey Tang:
Would any of your members happen to be in Taichung or Taiwan around May 5th and 6th?

### Hillary Liu:
Yes.

### Audrey Tang:
So come to the meeting.

### Audrey Tang:
I’m pretty sure I’ll come to Edinburgh. I don’t know about others...

### Hillary Liu:
But your agenda and your schedule. I think we could...

### Audrey Tang:
Supposedly, one of the SEWF team is also coming to the our event. We can figure out directly in May. I don’t know much about the September planning before May, actually.

### Hillary Liu:
Awesome. We can offer you that, because we have the program called Camford.

### Audrey Tang:
That’s right, that’s right.

### Hillary Liu:
Awesome, thank you. One more thing we want to offer you, that we have the Taiwan champion doing the tailor suit, that one.

### Audrey Tang:
The tailor of Chiang Kai-shek you mentioned last time?

> (laughter)

### Hillary Liu:
The family, the family.

### Audrey Tang:
The family of tailors for Chiang Kai-shek.

### Hillary Liu:
Yes. Then that’s what he’s proud of. We want to help this 70 years old man to polish his skills, and then to make us the SE for Taiwan, the suit.

### Audrey Tang:
Just include that in your email, and we’ll go through it point by point.

### Hillary Liu:
I think you can use some smile today, especially it’s for White Valentine’s Day.

### Audrey Tang:
Yeah. It’s great to have this chat.

### Audrey Tang:
I will send you the transcripts in the next 24 hours.

### Hillary Liu:
I always seem to remember the Wednesday thing, and then to meet your interesting crew, that I always want to come, always.

### Audrey Tang:
Yeah, the vTaiwan people, they’re there.

### Hillary Liu:
Yeah, so that’s why I said 7:30 hours, they’ll come and I’ll say hi.

### Hillary Liu:
I saw you brought them pizza.

### Audrey Tang:
Yeah, exactly.

### Audrey Tang:
Everybody, including me, is here for the pizza.

> (laughter)

### Audrey Tang:
We’re good. All right, cheers.

### Hillary Liu:
Thank you.

### Audrey Tang:
Ciao.
